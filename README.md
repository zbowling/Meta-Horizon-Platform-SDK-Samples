    * Android Studio Hedgehog or newer

## Getting Started
First, ensure that all of the [requirements](#requirements) are met.
Then, to build and run a sample:
1. Clone this repository to your computer
2. Open the specific sample app with Android Studio
3. Plugin in your Meta Quest device to your computer
4. Click the "Run" button in the Android Studio toolbar, the app will now be running on your headset

## AI coding agents

This repo is wired up for AI coding agents — `AGENTS.md`, `.vscode/extensions.json`, `.mcp.json`, `.cursor/rules/`, and a few client-specific dotfiles surface the **Meta Horizon** VS Code/Cursor extension, the `hzdb` MCP server, and the Meta Quest skill set automatically.

Full toolchain, including Android skills and per-client install instructions: [github.com/meta-quest/agentic-tools](https://github.com/meta-quest/agentic-tools).
